# Andreas Werner ‚Äì n8n Portfolio & Application

This repository bundles my portfolio for n8n: real-world workflow automation systems, AI-enabled tooling, and complementary product & technical work‚Äîshowcasing both healthcare automation agents and a creative tech prototype.

## üöÄ Projects Overview

### n8n Healthcare Agent Network (side project)
Multi-agent n8n workflow for a dermatology practice‚Äîhandling appointments, email triage, RAG-based diagnosis, and administrative automation to reduce manual overhead. Includes a custom retrieval/decision model fine-tuned by consolidating ~100 anonymized workflow Q&A pairs into a JSONL dataset for improved contextual reasoning.

### MIDI Sampler Prototype
A new sampler concept developed during a 12-month training program in product management at Franklin Institute - from user research to UI design in Figma and a working React prototype. Accelerated implementation with AI pair-programming agents in VS Code. Applied full-stack fundamentals (TypeScript, Node.js, REST) while iterating on backlog and product positioning through structured user interviews (JTBD), A/B testing, and market validation.

### Experimental AI-driven Scrum Agent Framework
Design and architecture of an n8n-based framework that orchestrates LLM-powered Scrum agents (PO, Dev, QA) to auto-generate, refine, and iterate code and backlog items‚Äîexploring AI-assisted agile delivery workflows.

# üìå Key Features

### 1. Example Agent Workflows

| Agent                         | Description                                                         |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **HealtcareAgent** 			| Core multi-agent flow combining scheduling, triage, and diagnosis   |
| **EmailAgent**                | Classifies, prioritizes, and routes incoming emails                 |
| **CalendarAgent**             | Suggests and schedules available appointments                       |
| **ScrumAgents**               | Experimental code development workflow                              |

### 2. Plugin Prototype

This prototype of an ipad app automates MIDI-based sequencing with focus on the creative use of randomization methods. Code, UI mockups, and iteration artifacts can be found in `/plugin-prototype/`.

## üîß Technologies Used

- **n8n** for workflow orchestration and automation  
- **Ollama with Mistral** for local LLM inference and decision support  
- **Supabase with pgvector** for RAG / vector-memory retrieval  
- **Custom fine-tuned retrieval model** based on workflow Q&A JSONL dataset  
- **Whisper & ElevenLabs** for speech interfaces  
- **VAPI + WebSocket** for real-time voice/agent integration  
- **VS Code** with AI pair-programming (e.g., RooCode/Copilot)  
- **React** for prototype UI, **TypeScript / Node.js** for backend logic  
- **Figma** for user-centered UI/UX design  
- **SQL / Supabase / Postgres** for data & insights  
- **Design Thinking / Agile frameworks** (Scrum, Kanban, JTBD, story mapping)  
- **GitHub** for version control and collaboration  

## üß† My Role & Contributions

- Conceptualized, built, and iterated end-to-end intelligent workflows and agent systems in n8n.  
- Conducted user research, translated findings into Jobs-to-Be-Done, and continuously refined product backlog.  
- Engineered prototypes combining UI design, AI-assisted development, and full-stack implementation.  
- Created and integrated a fine-tuned contextual model to improve decision relevance in agent workflows.  
- Applied agile delivery: roadmap ownership, sprint cadence, prioritization, and market positioning.
