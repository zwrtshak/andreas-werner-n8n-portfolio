# Application for Project Manager at n8n

**Hello n8n team!**

I found out about the open project manager position through an unusual encounter:

while I was recently working on one of my workflows in n8n on the flight back from London to Berlin, my seat neighbour tapped me: "Hey, you use n8n? I work there!" - It was Hermann Pfennigschiller from n8n and an interesting conversation began in which he enthusiastically told me about his amazing team and mentioned that you currently have several project manager positions open. I told him about my career and he expressly encouraged me to apply to you and also to exchange contacts so that he could make a recommendation if necessary. This moment felt like a stroke of fate for me, because during the past two years I have gained extensive hands-on experience with n8n by creating and implementing workflows in real projects.

So what started as a random seat assignment turned into an inspiring conversation about the future of workflow automation and led me to the realization that n8n might just be the right company to bring my passion for technology and project management to.

## Professional Background:

I am an IT product manager with an interdisciplinary background: After my diploma in audiovisual media at the Academy of Media Arts (a widely recognized institution where I designed interactive media installations such as an interactive dancefloor) I worked as an internationally touring musician and DJ for over two decades. I produced electronic music, played live shows and DJ gigs worldwide. During this time I developed my own midi sequencing tools and became increasingly involved with workflows, automation and creative process optimization.

In 2024, I began a 12-month training program as a product manager at the Franklin Institute for Applied Sciences, which I completed this year in June. There I designed my own music plugin and developed it into a prototype - including agile planning, design thinking, story mapping, product ownership and technical implementation, even coding the prototype of my plugin in VS Code. Originally, I planned to apply to Ableton or Arturia, but my focus has shifted due to my intensive work with n8n.

## Certifications & Qualifications:

- Completion of the Remote IT Project Management course at the Franklin Institute for Applied Science (2024)
- Scrum Master and Product Owner certificates at Scrum.org
- IHK certified
- Development of a music plugin as final project
- Two years of intensive practice with n8n in real projects
- Fluent English speaker, native German

## Relevant Experience:

- Diploma in audiovisual media design (Academy of Media Arts, Cologne - 2004)
- 20 years of experience as a producer and international DJ
- Deep expertise in creative workflows and digital production processes

## My connection to n8n:

I have been working with Artificial Intelligence and LLM technologies since 2022 and have spent almost every spare minute of the last two years understanding, designing and improving workflow concepts & automation systems. I am currently working on complex agent networks that connect local LLMs with n8n workflows. A coding engineer workflow with which I want to code my music plugins is one thing - the other is a joint project with two friends to automate processes in a doctor's office for dermatology. We are developing an agent network that includes appointment scheduling, email communication, document management and AI-based decision logic - all based on n8n. This experience has deepened my understanding of use cases, user needs and system architecture.

## Why I'm a strong candidate for n8n:

My diverse background brings a unique perspective:

- **Creative problem solving**: Two decades in music production have taught me to optimize complex, iterative workflows and find creative solutions to technical challenges.
- **Community insight**: As a DJ & Producer I understand the importance of developing tools that inspire both professionals and beginners - just like n8n.
- **Technical depth**: My experience with plugin development and agent networks shows that I not only understand complex technical concepts but can also implement them.
- **Project Management Expertise**: Freshly certified in modern PM methodologies, with hands-on experience in delivering technical projects. I developed strong self-management skills during my education at KHM Cologne (Academy of Media Arts), applied them throughout 20 years of professional work as a music producer and strengthened them during my product management training at the Franklin Institute.

## My vision for n8n:

I see n8n not just as a tool, but as an enabler of a new way of working. My experience with local LLMs, RAG systems and networks of AI agents shows me how n8n bridges the gap between AI innovation and practical implementation. As a project manager, I want to help n8n scale this vision - making automation accessible, ethical, and collaborative. For example: In my recent work on our AI assistant for medical practice, I experienced firsthand how essential it is to equip agents with structured, retrievable guidelines - not just prompts. Without a contextual knowledgebase, agents can easily drift away from what you actually want - especially in sensitive domains like healthcare. This insight strengthened my commitment to making systems more accessible to non-experts so that AI agents act in alignment with user intent. I believe n8n is uniquely positioned to help make sense of artificial intelligence and turn good ideas into real world solutions - combining technical excellence with user-friendliness.

## Next steps:

I am convinced that I can add real value to n8n with my experience in creative and technical processes, my strategic understanding and my aptitude for innovation. I would be happy to tell you more about my ideas and my motivation in a personal conversation. Sometimes the universe brings people together in the right place at the right time - I am convinced that my meeting with Hermann was more than just a coincidence - it was the moment when I realized that my path leads to n8n.

Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how my passion for n8n and my background in project management can contribute to your team.

Sincerely,  
**Andreas Werner**
