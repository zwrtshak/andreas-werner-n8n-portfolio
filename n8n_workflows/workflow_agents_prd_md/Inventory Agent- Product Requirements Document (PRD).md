**Inventory Agent: Product Requirements Document (PRD)**\
1. Purpose & Role\
The Inventory Agent is an intelligent sub-agent within the
SupervisorAgent system. It monitors the clinic\'s inventory levels,
detects shortages early, and prepares automated restocking actions. It
integrates with the Calendar Agent to forecast future supply needs and
operates under the authority of the SupervisorAgent, who must approve
all purchase actions.\
**2. Key Responsibilities**\
Inventory Monitoring

- Monitor stock levels of all listed medications, materials, and
  consumables.

- Compare actual vs. minimum/maximum thresholds.

- Flag critical inventory levels and notify the SupervisorAgent.\
  **Demand Forecasting via Calendar Integration**

<!-- -->

- Query upcoming appointments in the next quarter via the Calendar
  Agent.

- Analyze appointment types (e.g., biopsy, allergy test, injection) to
  estimate material needs.

- Compile an aggregated forecast based on future demand.\
  **Order Suggestions**

<!-- -->

- Propose precise reorder quantities based on current stock, historical
  usage, and forecast.

- Prioritize based on urgency (e.g., emergency medication, supply chain
  limits, shelf life).\
  **Supervisor Interaction & Human-in-the-Loop**

<!-- -->

- Before any order is placed: send JSON summary to SupervisorAgent.

- SupervisorAgent triggers human approval process.

- Only after human approval will the order be executed.\
  **3. Architecture & Integration**\
  Input from SupervisorAgent\
  {\
  \"action\": \"check_inventory\"\
  }\
  **Output Format: Order Proposal (requires approval)**\
  {\
  \"items_to_order\": \[\
  {\
  \"item_name\": \"Lidocaine 2% ampoules\",\
  \"current_stock\": 12,\
  \"recommended_quantity\": 50,\
  \"reason\": \"30 infiltrations scheduled in Q4\"\
  },\
  {\
  \"item_name\": \"Biopsy needle 4mm\",\
  \"current_stock\": 18,\
  \"recommended_quantity\": 40,\
  \"reason\": \"Forecast + safety buffer\"\
  }\
  \],\
  \"requires_approval\": true,\
  \"status\": \"pending_human_approval\"\
  }\
  **After Approval via Human-in-the-Loop**\
  {\
  \"status\": \"approved\",\
  \"order_executed\": true,\
  \"order_reference\": \"order_id_20250728\"\
  }\
  **4. Functions & Capabilities**\
  Rule-Based Monitoring

<!-- -->

- If current stock \< minimum threshold → trigger alert.

- If current stock \< forecasted demand → prepare reorder list.\
  **Calendar Agent Communication**

<!-- -->

- Request: \"Provide all appointments and types for next quarter.\"

- Map appointment types to material needs (e.g., \"Allergy Test\" →
  \"Histamine solution, disposable syringe\").\
  **Escalation Workflow**

<!-- -->

- In case of critical understocking, send alert to SupervisorAgent.

- Only SupervisorAgent can approve ordering.\
  **5. Security & Validation**

<!-- -->

- Validate item codes, quantities, and supplier constraints.

- No external API access without explicit SupervisorAgent instruction.

- No order placed unless \"status: approved\" is confirmed in JSON.\
  **6. Data Sources & Structure**

<!-- -->

- Local inventory database (e.g., Supabase inventory table):

  - item_id, name, category, stock_level, min_required, unit,
    last_order_date

<!-- -->

- Mapping table: appointment_type → material_requirements\[\]\
  **7. Performance & Reliability**

<!-- -->

- Runtime \< 3 seconds for full check and demand forecasting.

- Robust handling of appointment/material correlation, even with large
  datasets (\>500 appointments).\
  This PRD ensures the Inventory Agent performs intelligent,
  data-driven, and GDPR-compliant inventory control --- always under the
  supervision and approval of a human-in-the-loop via the
  SupervisorAgent.
